== Installation ==

Shortcode Factory is easy to install.

1. Download plugin zip file to your computer and extract in a folder
1. Upload `shortcode-factory` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin compatible with WordPress New Editor (a.k.a Gutenberg)? =

Yes, we have made this compatible in a way that you can continue with it like before. Simple look for a new "Shortcode Factory" dedicated panel in any block's inspector sidebar. The panel hosts a button (Add Shortcode) which you can click to open shortcodes dialogue. The same you can achieve by clicking gear icon on default editor toolbar (a.k.a formatting/alignment toolbar).

= Is the plugin still compatible with Classic Editor? I haven't upgrated to Gutenberg. =

Of course it is compatible with Classic, as well as, Gutenberg editor.

= Are you planning for any new blocks in Gutenberg editor? =

Yes, we are trying to gradually adopt new editor and it's features. We have already in plans to role out new changes and making it more compatible and native to the Gutenberg editor. Stay tuned for such changes in upcoming versions.

= How do I change the [More] label in 'link' return output of [scf-posts] short code? =

[scf-posts] offers `filter_label_more` filter, which can be used to override the default label for the link. See http://shortcodefactory.com/users-guide/scf-posts/ for details.

= Why [scf-register-link] is not showing a register link, while I am logged out? =

The "Register" link is not offered if the Administration > Settings > General > Membership: 'Anyone can register' box is not checked.

= Why [scf-register-link] is not working with WPMU? =

On WordPressMU, there is no /wp-register.php file, and /wp-login.php?action=register is not a valid registration form. Thus, wp_register function does not show a registration link.

= Does this plugin has a known conflict with Wordpress or other plugins? =

Although, we have tested it in very much detail. But technically, it shouldn’t create a conflict, since it does not try to change anything in the Wordpress System.

= What if I use another short code in [scf-allow]...[/scf-allow]? =

[scf-allow] supports "short code within short code", so your other short codes in an [scf-allow]...[/scf-allow] block are rendered pretty fine.

= How to add short code support in text widget? =

Simply enable "Text Widget Support" option under Dashboard -> Shortcode Factory -> Settings and save changes. On the other hand you can add `add_filter('widget_text', 'do_shortcode');` in your active theme's functions.php file.
